# task-scheduling-using-cuckoo-search-algorithm
The Cuckoo Search algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the brood parasitic
behavior of certain cuckoo species. It uses LÃ©vy flights to explore the search space and a fraction
probability to abandon worse solutions, ensuring a good balance between exploration and exploitation.

**Task Scheduling** in cloud computing involves assigning a set of tasks to a set of virtual machines
in a way that optimizes certain perfomance metrics such as makespan(the amount of time to process all
of the tasks), efficiency and throughput. The goal is to minimize the completion time of all tasks while
efficiently utilizing the available resources.
